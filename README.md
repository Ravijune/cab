# Topcoder CAB List

Welcome to CAB's list of items to be discussed with the Topcoder Team!

In an effort to be more transparent with the Topcoder Community we have created this Github issue tracker.  All members are welcome to log any issues or talking points that you would like CAB to bring up with the Topcoder Staff.  These issues will then be logged in the Project ("CAB Items") Board and will belong in 1 of 6 states: Ideas, Backlog, To-Do, In Progress, Complete, and Not Happening.

###Ideas
_This state is where an issue is first placed as it makes it's way through it's life on this board._

###Backlog
_This state is where issues are placed if they are deemed valid but low-priority_

###To-Do
_This state lists issues that are being discussed between CAB and the Topcoder Team to determine it's next state_

###In Progress
_This state lists issues that are deemed valid and contain a plan that is currently in motion_

###Complete
_This state lists items that have been finalized, closed, and solved_

###Not Happening
_This state lists items that will not ever be worked on_


##Rules
In order for this system to work properly, we ask that you adhere to the following 3 rules:

1. Everyone is allowed to create an issue
2. Everyone is allowed to comment on any issue
3. No one may adjust the Project Board except for Topcoder Admins

We look forward to everyone's collaboration and thank you for your efforts to make Topcoder the best crowdsourcing community!
