Welcome to CAB's list of items to be discussed with the Topcoder Team!

Previously our workflow with CAB has been for the CAB Members to listen out in the forums and other conversations and bring these topics up in our monthly meetings, which then was placed in an ongoing spreadsheet that was color-coded.  In an effort to facilitate this process, we have created this Github Issue Tracker!  Now any member can contribute to the future and improvement of Topcoder by logging an issue, which will then be brought to the attention of CAB and the Topcoder Team.

Every month CAB Members and the Topcoder Team meet and will go through the [Project Board](https://github.com/topcoderinc/cab/projects/1) determining which issues are of the most importance and what can realistically be accomplished.  This is a living/breathing board, so you may see actions being taken even between meetings.

#What Can You Do?<a name="whatcanyoudo"></a>
So as a Topcoder Member, what is it that you can accomplish on this Github Repo?

1. Create Issues
  * Launch a ticket to be considered by CAB.  Please make sure your ticket isn't a duplicate by viewing the [Project Board](https://github.com/topcoderinc/cab/projects/1)
2. Comment on Issues
  * Do you want to elaborate more on yours or someone else's ticket?  Feel free to start or jump into a conversation!
3. Reacting to Issues
  * This will help when escalating particular bugs/enhancements/ideas.  The more reactions for a particular ticket could escalate it much quicker to CAB and the Topcoder Team.

#Project Board<a name="projectboard"></a>
These issues will then be logged in the Project ("CAB Items") Board and will belong in 1 of 6 states: Ideas, Backlog, To-Do, In Progress, Complete, and Not Happening.

###Ideas
_This state is where an issue is first placed as it makes it's way through it's life on this board._

###Backlog
_This state is where issues are placed if they are deemed valid but low-priority_

###To-Do
_This state lists issues that are being discussed between CAB and the Topcoder Team to determine it's next state_

###In Progress
_This state lists issues that are deemed valid and contain a plan that is currently in motion_

###Complete
_This state lists items that have been finalized, closed, and solved_

###Not Happening
_This state lists items that will not ever be worked on_


#How-to<a name="howto">?


We look forward to everyone's collaboration and thank you for your efforts to make Topcoder the best crowdsourcing community!
